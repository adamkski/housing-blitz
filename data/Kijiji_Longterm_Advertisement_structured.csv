This simple compact cottage comes equipped with all your requirements for a real country retreat away from the city, but closes enough to commute. The cottage is clean and functional, not fancy and is the lowest price you will find on the lake.

The eat-in kitchen is equipped with fridge, stove, microwave, toaster, dishes, cutlery and pots and pans. Bring your own drinking water.

Bathroom has a bath with shower, toilet and small sink. Sleeps 4 in the 3 bedrooms, and more on the double pull-out and sofa in the living room (maximum occupancy is 6)

Living room comes with sofa, occasional chair, desk and airtight stove, HDTV, Blu-ray, stereo and great lake view.

The deck is feet away from Mississippi Lake. It has a screened Gazebo, BBQ, picnic table and chairs and a stunning view.

There is a dock and a fire bowl. You can swim; launch your kayaks, canoes and small motor boats at the cottage. For bigger boats you can use the public boat launch in Carleton Place. There is a canoe and paddle boat for use by visitors (with paddles and pfd’s). The cottage is pet friendly.

Parking for two vehicles is available beside the cottage.

Cell phones from all major providers work fine and are your source of internet.


Mississippi Lake is a well-looked after lake with great fishing and boating, many varieties of birds and other wildlife, and this location is very close (within a couple of kilometres) to a quiet, little known but very good golf course (Scottish Glen). Carleton Place is a lovely country location which has a variety of shops, a Saturday Farmers market and many other amenities, events and locations of interest. You are between 20 to 30 minute drive from nearby Almonte, Perth and Smith falls.

Booking week long stays at the moment (Sunday to Sunday) – will open to weekend only stays in Mid-June. Bookings on a ‘first come, first served’ basis. Book early to avoid disappointment.

The sooner the better but my priority is finding a compatible housemate.


Full-Time working male (60+ hours/week) seeking housemate to share 3 bedroom furnished* town house.

Available for August 1st, August 15th, or September 1st. Earliest date preferred.


* New coffee/end tables are ordered, waiting on delivery. You will need your own bedroom furnishings but there is an available queen size bed in the spare room that could be used temporarily.


Female preferred (cats are anxious around other males and I've always had a positive experience with female housemates, previous tenants will provide a recommendation if required). Although it is a 3 bedroom town house I am only interested in ONE adult to share the house with. You will have full access to the entire house, this is not a room-for-rent. My current housemate is moving out only to be closer to her family/work and she will provide a personal reference if required. I am very clean and keep to myself. There are also 2 cats that live with me or I guess you could say that I live with them! Due to this, the ad is listed as pet friendly but one additional cat would be the absolute maximum.


Please note: I will not be accepting the first qualified applicant and will be very thorough and selective with my decision. I feel it is very important to find someone compatible when it comes to sharing a house.

I am listing the rental amount at $630/month. This amount includes High Speed Internet (with Netflix!) and House Insurance (mandated by the landlord) but does NOT include Gas (Enbridge), Hydro (Ottawa Hydro), or Parking (if required). Hydro and Gas would be split 50/50 (estimates below). Outdoor parking is also available from the landlord (not me) at an additional rate of $45/month (it's actually $44/month until December).


Rental Breakdown (Estimated Bills)

Base Rent: $630

Enbridge Gas: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

Ottawa Hydro: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

• These amounts are estimates only and averages based off the previous year. This is to give you an annual estimate only. Some months may be much higher, some months may be much lower (heating in the winter, over all hot water usage, a/c units, laundry volume, etc). Your estimated monthly average would be in the $670 to $700/month range (+$45 if parking is required).


Only my name would be on the physical lease and utility bills but we would be signing both a Roomers and Boarders Agreement, along with a Roommate Agreement. I will provide signed receipts for rent and bills. I'm interested in a minimum of 1 year (longer preferred but not required) with month-to-month afterwards unless we agree to commit to another year. 60 days notice must be provided by either of us in order to terminate the tenancy agreement. Last month's rent (not including bills) will be required upon signing the agreement and first month's rent will be due upon move-in date (pro-rated daily if you move in mid-month).


House details;

• 3 Bedroom

• 2 Entrances

• 1.5 Bath (1 Full large bathroom upstairs + 1 toilet/sink downstairs)

• 90% furnished.

• Fridge, Stove, Microwave, Washer/Dryer (new).

• no dishwasher

• no central air-conditioning. You can install a window unit in your bedroom and/or living room but it will affect our Ottawa Hydro bill total in the summer months. I will still be splitting the bill 50/50 as I do have a window unit in my room and would benefit from any additional a/c units.

• Unfinished Basement.

• close to pretty much every type of store, walking distance to Farmboy, Gas Station, and Bus

• small playground in front of house

Feel free to message if you have additional questions!*


I am a 30 year-old professional female looking for a roommate for the apartment I am currently in. Full-time professional females only please. The room will be available as of this fall. Let me know when you were looking to move, I’m relatively flexible.


The Room, Location, Etc:


One bedroom available in a two bedroom apartment in Westboro (near the Superstore, Richmond Rd/Kirkwood area).


UPDATE 1: The photos of the room with furniture are from a previous roommate to show scale, however my current roommate will likely be leaving/selling her desk/dresser/bed etc. so there might be a possibility of having furniture. Let me know if that's something you're interested in.


UPDATE 2: My landlord (who is great!), will be updating the shower/tub area of the bathroom with a Bath Fitter soon, so half the bathroom will be brand new (and installed quickly!)! The bathroom is already quite nice, but this a cool extra perk I thought I'd mention :)


- The room is fairly large measuring in at 11’11” x 11’2” with a large window and large closet

- The unit is on the main floor of a triplex

- The unit has one shared bathroom

- Street parking only, or if you wanted, there is a paid underground lot nearby (5 minute walk). There is no parking space available for you on the premises since I occupy the only space for the unit.

- Ideal for either someone who doesn't drive, OR works ~9-5 type of hours in order to avoid bylaw tickets during the weekdays (bylaw doesn’t patrol our street on weekends)

- 5 minute walk to Westboro bus station (OC Transpo) which connects to LRT

- 2 minute walk to Superstore

- 5 minute walk to Farm Boy

- 3 minute drive to the highway on/off ramps

- Not a far walk or drive to Wellington West (Wellington Village), Hintonburg, Tunney’s Pasture, even downtown is a quick drive down Scott Street, the parkway, Richmond Rd, or the highway

- Air conditioning (central air)!

- Hardwood floors throughout

- Stainless steel kitchen appliances (dishwasher, fridge, stove)

- Nice natural light

- Coin-operated laundry in basement of building

- There is no storage available in or outside of the unit, so someone that doesn't have a ton of belongings is ideal since you'll be limited to the space in your room. (There is a den in the unit, but I use that room in its entirety and it is not available for your use. This is reflected in the price).

- No pets please


The neighbours on the street are close-knit, friendly, and family oriented. It's a warm, safe community.


The neighbours in our building are pleasant 20-30 somethings. I've been in this unit for 6 years and I've been very happy here.


About Me:


I'm a 30 year old woman who works from home most days as I run my own successful business of over 10 years. If you’re wondering what a roommate who works from home would be like, in my case I just work quietly between my desk in my room, and on my laptop in the living room (can’t sit in the same place all day haha).


I’m tidy, friendly, responsible, respectful, financially secure, tend to keep to myself but happy to watch some TV together, I don't party or have people over very often. I’ve had a few roommates over the years and they would all describe me as being very easy to live with. I can provide references if you like.


Looking For:


Looking for a roommate who is: a professional female ideally in the same age range (late 20's early 30's) who is responsible, friendly, quiet, and respectful. Since I work from home, I’d prefer a roommate who works outside of the home in a full time position.


Looking for someone who has all of the attributes one would want in a roommate: clean and tidy, cleans up after themselves especially in the kitchen, doesn’t leave clutter around, that kind of thing. I’d like someone who is quiet and doesn't play music or TV too loudly (the sound really carries).


I like to keep the apartment pretty quiet and peaceful, I wouldn’t want people coming in and out a lot. A couple friends over once in a while is perfect, but I wouldn’t want it to be a regular hang out spot.


I'm past the drinking/party phase of my life and looking for someone in the same boat.


Ideal roommate in a word? Chill. (Please, no drama or crazies, you know who you are haha).


You would pay me $975 on the 25th of each month and this covers all costs. Of course if the expenses change considerably, I would adjust this figure. However costs have stayed pretty consistent over the years so I don’t expect this to be an issue.


Being completely financially secure and able to pay on time every month is a must, which should go without saying. I don’t mess around with this, so if $975 sounds like it could be tight for you, this won’t be a good fit.


If you're interested, send me a message with some info about yourself! I will reply to those who seem like they could potentially be a good fit and we can go from there :)

This lovely, sunny, cozy 2 BR apartment is your answer! Available September 1st.

Located on the 2nd floor of a house, this place has TWO bedrooms that are pretty much the same size. No need to draw the short straw of who gets the tiny room.

Open concept kitchen, living room with south facing windows for all your sunshine needs in Ottawa’s dreary winter.

Not only do you get a great apartment, you also get your own front yard patio (not a balcony). The patio space is located on the ground level which means you can put a BBQ! Take that high-rise buildings!

Landlord lives next door, which is super convenient if Sunday eve at 8pm you have an apartment emergency. :-)

What else do you get in this unit?

&middot; Hardwood throughout most of the unit, new carpet in one bedroom. Carpet is much nicer on the tootsies when you wake up in the morning!

&middot; All old crappy windows replaced so you stay draft-free warm.

&middot; Heat, water and hot water.

&middot; A walkability index of 90 out of 100 which means you can pretty much walk anywhere you need.

&middot; A bike score of 100 out of 100!!! Biker’s heaven!

&middot; A transit score of 90 out of 100. Pretty dang awesome for Ottawa.

&middot; This place is even in range of those new e-scooters -awww yeah!

&middot; Close proximity (700m) to Lebreton Station and the new Confederation LRT Line for all your commuting needs.* (when it's running :S)

&middot; Living a life that is far too close to delicious places such as Art-Is-In (200m), Bridgehead’s main roastery (280m), Ward 14 (240m) Peitro's Corner (110m), Pubwells (62m). Or go across the tracks to a plethora of restaurants).

&middot; Burn all the good food off at Plant Recreation Centre (190m), the new O-Train Bike Paths, Ottawa River Bike Paths, Beaver Boxing (87m) or by walking through Chinatown, Little Italy, Hintonburg or to your downtown work or school.

What is extra?

&middot; Hydro (aka electricity). How much is it a month? I really can’t say since I don’t know if you live by candle light and are never home or have 10 plasma TVs and never leave your apartment/ home office.

&middot; Parking. Street parking is availble through the City.

No laundry on premises, although the previous tenant had an arrangement with the downstairs to do laundry in their unit.

Note that I'm selling all of the furniture at a huge discount to the person moving in. People willing to purchase the furniture are highly preferred.

Furniture for sale includes:

•	3-seater sofa

•	Coffee table and carpet

•	Side table

•	Sealy posturepedic Queen bed Eurotop (mattress + spring box)

The basement is a large open bachelor style apartment with a separate entrance, a den/furnace room, laundry room, and full bathroom. Please note that the basement does not have a kitchen.

I am also a stand up comedian who performs at YukYuks, Absolute Comedy etc.


The apartment can be unfurnished or partially furnished. I have some things stored that you could use (eg. coffee tables, TV stands, lamps, futon frame, couch, desk chairs etc).

About me: My name is Maddie, I am a 25 year old woman who has lived in this unit since September 2019. I work fulltime in the service industry, with various hours. I also have a small female, fully trained and friendly dog who also lives here. Looking for a roommate with a similar lifestyle to move in who can also hopefully become a friend. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, going out to eat, drinks/socializing with friends, exercising and outdoor activities. I’m very easy going, and friendly so I’m looking for someone of a similar mindset.

The kitchen features a dishwasher and is fully furnished. The living room is already fully furnished with a tv. Your bedroom would be unfurnished. The unit also includes a washer/dryer and central air.

Popular with students, SO - this one's for your parents! We are landlords who care. Unfortunately many properties are run by absentee landlords who rent their apartments unclean and with many things broken. This will never happen with us. We own a small number of rentals, we keep up with regular maintenance, and we know all our tenants by name. Students are our specialty and we understand university life, pressures and needs. Yes, we'll fix the toilets of course, but a good tenancy is about so much more than that. We have two children ourselves so we know how much you will worry sending them away.

Further down the hall, you will find a separated dinning area.

The demarcated living room features a fireplace and windows to brighten the room.

The main floor also has a walk out to a fenced backyard with deck for BBQs and lounging on summer days. Like gardening? The backyard has some gardening space should you have a green thumb, yet just enough that you won't have to do too much mowing.

It's a 3 Bedroom + Den townhouse that's within a reasonable commute to Carleton and U Ottawa.


You will be getting the second bedroom upstairs that's beside the Master Bedroom. The room can come semi-furnished if you'd like, there are a couple of things available if you'd like such as a..

- light stand

- end table

-bed frame


If you don't want any of those that's fine as well, just an option if you wanted to get started with anything.

Rent is $699 (hydro included) plus internet being an additional charge (around ~$18)


There is one dog already here so unfortunately, it's not the best to introduce a new pet however you're more than welcome to enjoy the benefits of a dog without taking care of one!


The house is occupied by myself and two others, one is a full time student and the rest are young working professionals and we are hoping to find someone similar to us in that regard.


Move in date is August 1st with a 1 year term and we will require a first/last months rent. We will also be moving things in throughout the end of July and will also have a moving truck so if you need a hand with anything I'm sure we can work something out to help you get situated. Also something to note every door in the house locks.

the new mattamy development of ""Fairwinds"". There are 4 bedrooms, and 3.5

bathrooms.


The ground floor has been converted into a guest bedroom plus an

ensuite washroom. On this level you will find the laundry facilities.


The main (2nd) level of the townhome has a living room with hardwood floors, a

powder room/bath, and a kitchen/dining room with access to a large patio

situated on top of the garage.


The third level contains the master bedroom and two other smaller bedrooms.

There is a shared bathroom between the two smaller bedrooms. The master

bedroom has an ensuite bathroom with ceramic tile flooring as well as a

walk-in closet.


The basement is unfinished, and as to the exterior of the house, there should

be minimal yard maintenance as the townhome has a small yard in the front and

NO yard in the back (instead allocating the space to the garage and patio).


There is an inline water heater, and high ceilings throughout lend a spacious

feeling.


In terms of Amenities, you will be close to a lot of shopping. Tanger Outlet

mall, Kanata Centrum, and new shopping developments along Hazeldean Road are

all within a very short drive, or possibly a walk (to hazeldean). Costco is

also situated nearby. There are walking trails nearby along poole creek.

on/off ramp, however it is not so close that traffic noise is particularly

noticeable. In terms of public transit, the #62 and #162 bus service the

neighbourhood, and the #61 is also within walking distance. The ""Rush Hour""

service also includes the #261 and #263.


For perspective tenants with children, there are nearby neighborhood parks,

some of which have water 'features' for children during the summer.
