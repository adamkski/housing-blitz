You don't want to miss out on this opportunity for an unexpected last minute cabin rental available in August!!


It is still summer, but if you've been waiting to take a long awaited vacation or want a quiet, peaceful retreat to work remotely when the autumn leaves begin to turn, this is the place. There is no better location to see the beauty of the fall colours than here.


This beautiful, log cabin looks like it could be on a Canadian postcard. It is nestled on a beautiful double treed lot with breathtaking views of Negeek Lake and the Madawaska River. Open the door and this rustic, cozy cabin beckons for you to escape it all. From the gorgeous log walls to the unique and ornate headboards made of branches and log pieces, this place is one of a kind. The open concept allows plenty of room and sleeps up to 4 adults and 2 children comfortably.


Spend days at the water and evenings by the fire pit listening to the loons. This river is their haven. On rainy nights curl up on one of the day beds with a book or enjoy the roomy space and large table for a game of cards. Best of all, brace yourself for sunsets that will take your breath away. The spacious and flat lot is also perfect to set up a net for volleyball or badminton, or just let the kids play! The cabin is located on a quiet dead end road, so it's safe and perfect for a walk or bike ride.


The whole area is absolutely stunning and offers clear water, sandy shores, waterways to explore, amazing restaurants and a variety of lovely shops with unique items. All of this keeps people coming back year after year. Algonquin Park is only an hour away, so it's perfect for a day trip. When you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, we welcome you to a peaceful retreat that you can enjoy with family and friends, or on your own. Located only 2 hours west of Ottawa and a few hours north of Toronto, this could be yours for an end of the summer or fall getaway.


Want to get out on the river? Explore over 90 km of waterways with great fishing and boating. The 150 feet of natural shoreline has a sandy bottom with a gradual slope, so you have peace of mind when the kids are in the water. Feel free to bring your own watercraft or rent a boat from a nearby marina right across the river. Our 24 foot dock is at your disposal, and a boat launch is only 5 minutes away.

Looking for a young female professional to be my roommate. Move in OCT 1 OR NOV 1.


The apartment:

1 unfurnished bedroom in a spacious 1000sq. ft. furnished apartment in the heart of Westboro. Bright, big windows, hardwood floors, newly renovated bathroom and kitchen. Laundry room in basement / storage room, shared with the other two units in the house (one of which is the homeowners). Awesome, young, proactive landlords. I have lived here for three years and absolutely love the apartment and location.

*Pictures reflect two different living room layouts

**If you have an apartment sized couch or dining set that you want to bring, I may be willing to get rid of the current ones. Desk also available to keep in bedroom for studying/WFH.


Half a block up from Richmond Rd. Five minute walk from Superstore, Farmboy, LCBO, Westboro Village shops, 10 min walk to Westboro bus station. Located right by the Byron pathway, awesome for biking and walking.


$950/month includes all utilities and parking. Rent, high speed bell internet, hydro, insurance, laundry, parking. Rent would be due on the 25th of the month, and will only change if the cost of utilities changes significantly, which I don't anticipate happening as I have lived here for over two years and it has barely fluctuated.

6 month contract with option to go month-to-month after.


About me:

I am a 26 year old professional who works downtown on weekdays and at a restaurant on evenings/weekends. I am an extroverted introvert - I love my quiet time at home and am okay if we keep to ourselves, but also would be more than happy to have someone to share wine and good food with! I am very athletic, love to cook, but am at home very little due to my busy work schedule. I keep the house extremely tidy and need someone who is looking to share the responsibility of cleaning and keeping the space neat. I do not have guests often, especially now with covid, and would hopefully find someone who also isn't trying to entertain too frequently. Ideal roommate is also a young female professional with a day job, someone who is friendly and respectful and financially secure.


Please reply to this post with some information about yourself and we can set up a time to meet!

Looking for a young female professional to be my roommate. Move in OCT 1 OR NOV 1.


The apartment:

1 unfurnished bedroom in a spacious 1000sq. ft. furnished apartment in the heart of Westboro. Bright, big windows, hardwood floors, newly renovated bathroom and kitchen. Laundry room in basement / storage room, shared with the other two units in the house (one of which is the homeowners). Awesome, young, proactive landlords. I have lived here for three years and absolutely love the apartment and location.

*Pictures reflect two different living room layouts

**If you have an apartment sized couch or dining set that you want to bring, I may be willing to get rid of the current ones. Desk also available to keep in bedroom for studying/WFH.


Half a block up from Richmond Rd. Five minute walk from Superstore, Farmboy, LCBO, Westboro Village shops, 10 min walk to Westboro bus station. Located right by the Byron pathway, awesome for biking and walking.


$950/month includes all utilities and driveway parking spot. Rent, high speed bell internet, hydro, insurance, laundry, parking. Rent would be due on the 25th of the month, and will only change if the cost of utilities changes significantly, which would be transparently communicated with notice.


6 month contract with option to go month-to-month after.


About me:

I am a 26 year old professional who works downtown on weekdays and at a restaurant on evenings/weekends. I am an extroverted introvert - I love my quiet time at home and am okay if we keep to ourselves, but also would be more than happy to have someone to share wine and good food with! I am very athletic, love to cook, but am at home very little due to my busy work schedule. I keep the house extremely tidy and need someone who is looking to share the responsibility of cleaning and keeping the space neat. I do not have guests often, especially now with covid, and would hopefully find someone who also isn't trying to entertain too frequently. Ideal roommate is also a young female professional with a day job, someone who is friendly and respectful and financially secure.


Please reply to this post with some information about yourself and we can set up a time to meet!

Thank you,

Quiet family neighborhood with nice large park, children’s playground, tennis and basketball courts and even two docks for kayaking on Rideau River and Rideau Canal – all within 500 meters or less from the house. You can bike, skate (in the winter) or even walk to downtown (although walking may take about 30 minutes).


The house has 2 bedrooms and a bathroom on the second floor, eat-in kitchen and living and dining rooms on the first floor. Partially finished basement has an additional recreational room and office nook. Central A/C, all appliances and a functional fireplace. Large fenced backyard with a deck. Ideal for a small family, a couple, or for a single person who wants extra space and privacy close to the city center.


Please, check the youtube video for the tour of the house and the neighborhood. This video consists of three parts. The first part (5min 31 sec) is the tour of the house. The second part (5:11-11:16) is the walk from the house to the Brantwood park and Rideau River as well as the views there. The third part (from 11:16 till the end of the video) is the walk from the house to Main street, St. Paul University and Rideau Canal. The second and third parts may be boring since about half of them are just a walk on the street, but I wanted to show you how close everything is.


Please note that all photos and video were made 3 years ago - some walls may be painted in different colours and the furniture in the house (that belongs to current tenant) is different. Also, a new pedestrian bridge across the canal has being build since the video has being recorded.


Available starting November 1st. 24 hour notice required to view the house. Rent is $2,100 + utilities

The sooner the better but my priority is finding a compatible housemate.


Full-Time working male (60+ hours/week) seeking housemate to share 3 bedroom furnished* town house.

Available for August 1st, August 15th, or September 1st. Earliest date preferred.


* New coffee/end tables are ordered, waiting on delivery. You will need your own bedroom furnishings but there is an available queen size bed in the spare room that could be used temporarily.


Female preferred (cats are anxious around other males and I've always had a positive experience with female housemates, previous tenants will provide a recommendation if required). Although it is a 3 bedroom town house I am only interested in ONE adult to share the house with. You will have full access to the entire house, this is not a room-for-rent. My current housemate is moving out only to be closer to her family/work and she will provide a personal reference if required. I am very clean and keep to myself. There are also 2 cats that live with me or I guess you could say that I live with them! Due to this, the ad is listed as pet friendly but one additional cat would be the absolute maximum.


Please note: I will not be accepting the first qualified applicant and will be very thorough and selective with my decision. I feel it is very important to find someone compatible when it comes to sharing a house.

I am listing the rental amount at $630/month. This amount includes High Speed Internet (with Netflix!) and House Insurance (mandated by the landlord) but does NOT include Gas (Enbridge), Hydro (Ottawa Hydro), or Parking (if required). Hydro and Gas would be split 50/50 (estimates below). Outdoor parking is also available from the landlord (not me) at an additional rate of $45/month (it's actually $44/month until December).


Rental Breakdown (Estimated Bills)

Base Rent: $630

Enbridge Gas: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

Ottawa Hydro: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

• These amounts are estimates only and averages based off the previous year. This is to give you an annual estimate only. Some months may be much higher, some months may be much lower (heating in the winter, over all hot water usage, a/c units, laundry volume, etc). Your estimated monthly average would be in the $670 to $700/month range (+$45 if parking is required).


Only my name would be on the physical lease and utility bills but we would be signing both a Roomers and Boarders Agreement, along with a Roommate Agreement. I will provide signed receipts for rent and bills. I'm interested in a minimum of 1 year (longer preferred but not required) with month-to-month afterwards unless we agree to commit to another year. 60 days notice must be provided by either of us in order to terminate the tenancy agreement. Last month's rent (not including bills) will be required upon signing the agreement and first month's rent will be due upon move-in date (pro-rated daily if you move in mid-month).


House details;

• 3 Bedroom

• 2 Entrances

• 1.5 Bath (1 Full large bathroom upstairs + 1 toilet/sink downstairs)

• 90% furnished.

• Fridge, Stove, Microwave, Washer/Dryer (new).

• no dishwasher

• no central air-conditioning. You can install a window unit in your bedroom and/or living room but it will affect our Ottawa Hydro bill total in the summer months. I will still be splitting the bill 50/50 as I do have a window unit in my room and would benefit from any additional a/c units.

• Unfinished Basement.

• close to pretty much every type of store, walking distance to Farmboy, Gas Station, and Bus

• small playground in front of house

• smokers welcomed but NOT in the house, ever.

Only 45 minutes from downtown Ottawa and within 20 minutes of Wakefield and all 3 ski hills: Mont Cascade / Edelweiss / Camp Fortune.


Situated directly on beautiful lake St-Pierre de Wakefield this secluded cabin accommodates a family of four.


Ottawa Canada.–based Storm Architecture by cdrg+RedTeam designed and built the cabin using only the simplest of materials—wood timber frame construction with beautiful BC fur—to enclose a modest 1,200 square feet.


The cabin provides an escape with a remarkable sense of place created through sophisticated spatial and compositional means.


The cabin situated atop a granite bluff to create an idyllic retreat. Imagine a natural, rustic cabin with all the modern amenities of a modern custom home that fits the lay of the land and the outdoors-oriented lifestyle.


Timber Frame Hybrid endure as ideal expressions of the harmony that can be achieved between mankind and nature. With walls of wood in its almost natural form, they bring us intimately closer to our surroundings.


A new twist on an timber frame design, this cabin has a traditional gabled roof with the modern addition of two other porch roofs on either side of the structure.

The apartment is COVID-safe: it is conveniently located on the second floor of the building, with a staircase in and out via a side entrance, limiting, for all intents and purposes, any direct contact with other residents. In addition, the heating and ventilation system is localized within the unit, limiting the circulation of air between units.

The inside is not all this apartment has to offer, though. There’s also a private patio with a cafe-style table for eating outside when the weather’s good. We have lovely table clothes and linens to accompany your outdoor eating.

THE HOOD


Centretown is a great neighbourhood, with everything that you need at your fingertips! It has a vibrant, multicultural feel to it, and you can easily get to all that Ottawa has to offer, including the University of Ottawa (20 minutes on foot), the Parliament Buildings (15 minutes on foot), Byward Market (25 minutes on foot), and many other attractions!


There are also plenty of coffee shops, great restaurants, and the vibrant scene along Bank Street. You’re also only a hop, skip, and a jump away from China Town and Little Italy.


GETTING AROUND


The apartment is right near a major transit link on Bank St. Busses run along the street that link of up Ottawa’s transport network. Taking the bus is easy, and getting to and from the apartment is also pretty easy on bike or foot.

Feel free to message if you have additional questions!*


I am a 30 year-old professional female looking for a roommate for the apartment I am currently in. Full-time professional non-smoking females only please. The room will be available as of this fall. Let me know when you were looking to move, I’m relatively flexible.


THE ROOM, LOCATION, ETC:


One bedroom available in a two bedroom apartment in Westboro (near the Superstore, Richmond Rd/Kirkwood area).


The photos of the room with furniture are from a previous roommate just to show scale, however my current roommate might be willing to leave/sell some of her furniture, and this could be discussed if you're interested.


- The room is fairly large measuring in at 11’11” x 11’2” with a large window and large closet

- The unit is on the main floor of a triplex

- The unit has one shared bathroom, with a brand new Bath Fitter being installed soon!

- Street parking only, or if you wanted, there is a paid underground lot nearby (5 minute walk). There is no parking space available for you on the premises since I occupy the only space for the unit.

- Ideal for either someone who doesn't drive, OR works ~9-5 type of hours in order to avoid bylaw tickets during the weekdays (bylaw doesn’t patrol our street on weekends)

- 5 minute walk to Westboro bus station (OC Transpo) which connects to LRT

- 2 minute walk to Superstore

- 5 minute walk to Farm Boy

- 3 minute drive to the highway on/off ramps

- Not a far walk or drive to Wellington West (Wellington Village), Hintonburg, Tunney’s Pasture, even downtown is a quick drive down Scott Street, the parkway, Richmond Rd, or the highway

- Air conditioning (central air)!

- Hardwood floors throughout

- Stainless steel kitchen appliances (dishwasher, fridge, stove)

- Nice natural light

- Coin-operated laundry in basement of building

- There is no storage available in or outside of the unit, so someone that doesn't have a ton of belongings is ideal since you'll be limited to the space in your room. (There is a den in the unit, but I use that room in its entirety and it is not available for your use. This is reflected in the price).

- No pets please


The neighbours on the street are close-knit, friendly, and family oriented. It's a warm, safe community.


The neighbours in our building are pleasant 20-30 somethings. I've been in this unit for 6 years and I've been very happy here.


ABOUT ME:


I'm a 30 year old woman who works from home most days as I run my own successful business of over 10 years. If you’re wondering what a roommate who works from home would be like, in my case I just work quietly between my desk in my room, and on my laptop in the living room (can’t sit in the same place all day haha).


I’m tidy, friendly, responsible, respectful, financially secure. I'm happy to keep to myself but also down to hang out a bit and watch some TV together if we click. I don't party or have people over very often (almost never now with COVID). I’ve had a few roommates over the years and they would all describe me as being very easy to live with. I can provide references if you like :)


LOOKING FOR:


Looking for a roommate who is: a professional female ideally in the same age range (late 20's early 30's) who is responsible, friendly, quiet, respectful, and a non-smoker.


Looking for someone who has all of the attributes one would want in a roommate: clean and tidy, cleans up after themselves especially in the kitchen, doesn’t leave clutter around, that kind of thing. I’d like someone who is quiet and doesn't play music or TV too loudly, especially with the other neighbours in the building in mind.


I like to keep the apartment pretty quiet and peaceful, I wouldn’t want people coming in and out a lot generally, but especially right now with COVID.


I'm past the drinking/party phase of my life and looking for someone in the same boat.


Ideal roommate in a word? Chill. (Please, no drama or crazies, you know who you are haha).


You would pay me $960 on the 25th of each month and this covers all costs. Of course if the expenses change considerably, I would adjust this figure. However costs have stayed pretty consistent over the years so I don’t expect this to be an issue.


Being completely financially secure and able to pay on time every month is a must, which should go without saying. I don’t mess around with this, so if $960 sounds like it would be tight for you, this won’t be a good fit.


If you're interested, send me a message with some info about yourself! I will reply to those who seem like they could potentially be a good fit and we can go from there :)

Everything about this place is new and untouched. Large windows, pair with light coloured wood and eggshell walls to optimizes natural light.

The Tour

Upon entering, we step up from the tile onto the engineered hardwood after jackets go into the spacious closet. From here, we can reach the basement, as well as the garage, which can be manually operated or controlled through an app.
There is a powder room and a sliding door that leads to the backyard.

Up the stairs, and you’ll meet the wide open living room and kitchen. With near floor to ceiling windows, this is the highlight. The kitchen is made with black granite, and brand new GE appliances. The balcony sits just outside the kitchen. What will you do with it? Maybe yoga, gardening, barbecues? (We’re thinking little movie nights with string lights.)

Finally, the top floor has 3 bedrooms and 2 full washrooms. The master bedroom with a full washroom and walk-in closet attached, and you can find the other washroom with a large mirror further down the hall. Extra storage is in a sliding closet, and a slimmer door reveals a stacked washer and dryer.

Location

Terravita Private is a 3 minute drive from South Keys, or Greenboro (main bus and train stations to get into the city from this end). South Keys is a strip mall with a Walmart, Loblaws, Marshalls, and restaurants, all the way to the Greenboro station. There is a bus stop across the street from the townhome to get you there in 5 minutes. Our space is also situated across the street from a quaint shopping plaza, which has a Lonestar, A&W, Petro Canada, or Starbucks for a quick bite.

We’re so excited for you to see it. Send us a message here, or email me at elainesitu@rogers.com to arrange a private viewing. It is available at the beginning of November.

Your roommate is a 27 year old english major student, male, gamer, private, minds his business but has good social skills.


Your rent is $537.50 plus $30 internet and half of hydro (very cheap in quebec!) First and last month is required: a total of $1075 upfront.

We Changed a few things in both washrooms (Vanity and toilets) new paint new taps clean up floor grout, small backsplash, cleaned up old caulking with new fresh caulking...

As for the kitchen, client wanted to keep his existing cabinets, yet some had to be cut to new size such as MW such as the uppers over the island, Took as little as possible out of a wall to not effect flooring, ceilings and to not create too much electrical work, added a Backsplash and a few things more and VOILA!.
