These photos were taken before the current tenants moved in. Not shown in the photos are the 5 to 7 appliances that will be included. As you can see the main floor is predominantly real hardwood flooring and ceramic tile. Because of the inconvenience of the renovations and the current worn state of the upstairs flooring (predominantly carpet) we are considering offering a special promotional discounted rent. The outgoing tenants have not been kind to the home; consequently renovations will be underway. The home was gorgeous before the last tenants moved in and will be gorgeous again in the near future.

I'm looking for a responsible tenant who would pass a credit check (and reference check) to takeover my lease. You would have to pay Oct 1 to my landlord and 1300$ to me (because I have already paid last month's rent).


Photos: in the photo you see the large bedroom and the kitchen. The other part of the kitchen is a tiny seating area for dining/lounging. The main bedroom photographed is big. Maybe 11x13? Tall ceilings. There's also a second bedroom but I use it as an office or a guest room. It can only fit a twin size bed for guests and a small desk. The closet for that bedroom is outside the room. There's also a cute hallway. I'll update more photos at the end of August.


I will be able to provide showings over the month of September, so please message me for viewings on the first week of September. I would like to confirm a tenant and have them confirmed by my landlord by the end of the second week of September.


Worst case scenario, I would accept a subletter to enter a contract directly with me, but I would prefer someone take over my lease.


The location is insane, and there are condos propping up everywhere around my apartment building. The building itself is super old, but I'm sure I have the nicest unit in the property. Bathroom is new, the whole place is newly painted and has new flooring. Absolutely no pest issues and super clean (inside my unit). New stove and oven (i'm the first one to use it). There is great heating but no air-conditioning.

There is laundry in the building, but it's really basic and old looking.",Yes,1,2,Owner,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have decided to rent out our beautiful waterfront cottage on the Ottawa River in Campbell’s Bay, QC! This place has everything you need to enjoy a week away from the city! Whether its relaxing or playing in the sand, swimming in the river or hanging out on the dock, playing games on the lawn or reading in the shade, roasting marshmallows or roasting in the barrel sauna, THIS PLACE HAS IT ALL! Please take a look at the pictures and see for yourself! The river is a boaters paradise so if you have a boat, just drop it in the water down the street, park it at the dock and whenever you’re ready, fill the cooler and head out to one of the many sand bars or sandy beaches up river! Being situated in a small town means that you do have neighbours, but when you’re down at the water you won’t even notice! The town has its perks; the boat launch, the corner store for food, beer, or any random things you may need, even a fresh pizza if you don’t feel like cooking, or walk up to the chip truck for a poutine, you can even head over to the microbrewery for cold beer! **Photos have boats, but they are not included and will not be at the dock.

The sooner the better but my priority is finding a compatible housemate.


Full-Time working male (60+ hours/week) seeking housemate to share 3 bedroom furnished* town house.

Available for August 1st, August 15th, or September 1st. Earliest date preferred.


* New coffee/end tables are ordered, waiting on delivery. You will need your own bedroom furnishings but there is an available queen size bed in the spare room that could be used temporarily.


Female preferred (cats are anxious around other males and I've always had a positive experience with female housemates, previous tenants will provide a recommendation if required). Although it is a 3 bedroom town house I am only interested in ONE adult to share the house with. You will have full access to the entire house, this is not a room-for-rent. My current housemate is moving out only to be closer to her family/work and she will provide a personal reference if required. I am very clean and keep to myself. There are also 2 cats that live with me or I guess you could say that I live with them! Due to this, the ad is listed as pet friendly but one additional cat would be the absolute maximum.


Please note: I will not be accepting the first qualified applicant and will be very thorough and selective with my decision. I feel it is very important to find someone compatible when it comes to sharing a house.

I am listing the rental amount at $630/month. This amount includes High Speed Internet (with Netflix!) and House Insurance (mandated by the landlord) but does NOT include Gas (Enbridge), Hydro (Ottawa Hydro), or Parking (if required). Hydro and Gas would be split 50/50 (estimates below). Outdoor parking is also available from the landlord (not me) at an additional rate of $45/month (it's actually $44/month until December).


Rental Breakdown (Estimated Bills)

Base Rent: $630

Enbridge Gas: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

Ottawa Hydro: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

• These amounts are estimates only and averages based off the previous year. This is to give you an annual estimate only. Some months may be much higher, some months may be much lower (heating in the winter, over all hot water usage, a/c units, laundry volume, etc). Your estimated monthly average would be in the $670 to $700/month range (+$45 if parking is required).


Only my name would be on the physical lease and utility bills but we would be signing both a Roomers and Boarders Agreement, along with a Roommate Agreement. I will provide signed receipts for rent and bills. I'm interested in a minimum of 1 year (longer preferred but not required) with month-to-month afterwards unless we agree to commit to another year. 60 days notice must be provided by either of us in order to terminate the tenancy agreement. Last month's rent (not including bills) will be required upon signing the agreement and first month's rent will be due upon move-in date (pro-rated daily if you move in mid-month).


House details;

• 3 Bedroom

• 2 Entrances

• 1.5 Bath (1 Full large bathroom upstairs + 1 toilet/sink downstairs)

• 90% furnished.

• Fridge, Stove, Microwave, Washer/Dryer (new).

• no dishwasher

• no central air-conditioning. You can install a window unit in your bedroom and/or living room but it will affect our Ottawa Hydro bill total in the summer months. I will still be splitting the bill 50/50 as I do have a window unit in my room and would benefit from any additional a/c units.

• Unfinished Basement.

• close to pretty much every type of store, walking distance to Farmboy, Gas Station, and Bus

Bachelor/studio apartment for rent, in the basement of my private (family) residence, in quiet residential Ottawa neighbourhood, (near Alta Vista Drive and Pleasant Park Road).


Self-contained with private entrance; fully-equipped kitchen; full-size laundry washer and dryer also contained within apartment; (no more trips to the laundromat!)

One-year lease; then two months notice for termination.


This is for single-person occupancy only (not coded for couples; no room mates)


Absolutely no sub-leasing.


Please email for an appointment to see if interested. No telephone calls, please. If you are reading this ad, the apartment is still available.


First class location:

- 30 seconds walk to No 44 and No 149 bus routes;

- 7 min walk to Pleasant Park Transitway Station;

- University of Ottawa: 45 min walk; or 10 min bus ride;

- Carleton University: 45 min walk; or 25 min bus ride;

Non-smokers only. (No exceptions)


Ideal for a mature university student, young professional, nurse, or medical intern/resident.


No on-site parking available; street parking technically a possibility, but this has proved problematic to previous tenants -- parking tickets have been regularly issued for long term stays -- especially in the winter. In other words, this is not really an apartment for someone with a car.


First month’s rent is required on signing the lease; last month is required on taking possession.


Note: If you are wondering if it’s pet-friendly, I believe the answer is no. I have nothing against pets (I have a Husky-Shepherd dog, myself), but I believe the apartment is too small for dogs, and I don’t think my dog and a cat will mix very well.

I know it says September to April, but I am willing to be flexible on the starting date (be it November, December, etc...).


Gas, internet, and hydro combined is typically $60 monthly. So expect ~ $590-$620 a month total.


The apartment comes with laundry facilities, however, is shared between two households (as the apartment is a duplex). There is also a garage behind the house that could probably fit two small cars inside.


There is a small closet in the room, however as you can see I have shoved my desk in there :). Additionally, there is a storage space/closet on the outside of the room as well (where I store all my clothing).


The current tenants are composed of 4th year engineering and computer science students who typically don't party much, especially on our own property. Very easy going and a great crew to hang around with :)

I love my condo and am looking for a renter who will love the space as much as me!


--About The Unit--

The unit is 3 years old on the 24th floor of the Tribeca East building and boasts 5 large floor-to-ceiling windows. It comes with awesome black-out blinds that will make it nighttime in the day time and let lovely light in when you want it. While the unit faces the building across (west-facing windows with lots of sunshine!), it is high up enough to have a beautiful view of the financial district from the north and glebe from the south. It's move-in ready when you are!


Yes, it is a studio apartment; the kitchen, living, and bedroom are in one continuous space. The unit is 500 square feet and has a great floorplan that makes the bedroom - while in the continuous space - still separate from the living room and kitchen. There are stainless steel kitchen appliances, granite countertops, and hardwood floors.


The Internet is included. No utilities. No parking (but you won't need it with all the great walking distance places!). IN-SUITE laundry. The unit comes furnished (But no TV! A universal TV mount is there and available for your use) but we can talk about alternatives. The unit will be professionally washed prior to move in!


--About The Building--

I've listed the great amenities of the unit on the ad, have a look. There’s a gym, 24-hour security, concierge, storage locker included, and meeting rooms and guest rooms at an extra fee to the condo board. The building is also managed using an app so if there are any maintenance requests for the condo board’s attention, they can be set up there. This is also how the condo board communicates with you.


--About The Location--

With Farmboy and Rexall just downstairs, the building is a five-ten minute walk to Parliament Station (OTrain), Elgin Street, Financial District, parks, museums, landmarks!


--To Set Up a Viewing--

Given the COVID-19 situation, I am happy to send you a video walk-through of the unit if you are interested. We can talk about the next steps from there. Safety first!


--To Apply--

Please keep in mind that I am looking for someone interested in a one-year lease, moving in September 1, 2020. I can arrange for earlier as well.

We Changed a few things in both washrooms (Vanity and toilets) new paint new taps clean up floor grout, small backsplash, cleaned up old caulking with new fresh caulking...

As for the kitchen, client wanted to keep his existing cabinets, yet some had to be cut to new size such as MW such as the uppers over the island, Took as little as possible out of a wall to not effect flooring, ceilings and to not create too much electrical work, added a Backsplash and a few things more and VOILA!.

Feel free to message if you have additional questions!*


I am a 30 year-old professional female looking for a roommate for the apartment I am currently in. Full-time professional females only please. The room will be available as of this fall. Let me know when you were looking to move, I’m relatively flexible.


The Room, Location, Etc:


One bedroom available in a two bedroom apartment in Westboro (near the Superstore, Richmond Rd/Kirkwood area).


UPDATE 1: The photos of the room with furniture are from a previous roommate to show scale, however my current roommate will likely be leaving/selling her desk/dresser/bed etc. so there might be a possibility of having furniture. Let me know if that's something you're interested in.


UPDATE 2: My landlord (who is great!), will be updating the shower/tub area of the bathroom with a Bath Fitter soon, so half the bathroom will be brand new (and installed quickly!)! The bathroom is already quite nice, but this a cool extra perk I thought I'd mention :)


- The room is fairly large measuring in at 11’11” x 11’2” with a large window and large closet

- The unit is on the main floor of a triplex

- The unit has one shared bathroom

- Street parking only, or if you wanted, there is a paid underground lot nearby (5 minute walk). There is no parking space available for you on the premises since I occupy the only space for the unit.

- Ideal for either someone who doesn't drive, OR works ~9-5 type of hours in order to avoid bylaw tickets during the weekdays (bylaw doesn’t patrol our street on weekends)

- 5 minute walk to Westboro bus station (OC Transpo) which connects to LRT

- 2 minute walk to Superstore

- 5 minute walk to Farm Boy

- 3 minute drive to the highway on/off ramps

- Not a far walk or drive to Wellington West (Wellington Village), Hintonburg, Tunney’s Pasture, even downtown is a quick drive down Scott Street, the parkway, Richmond Rd, or the highway

- Air conditioning (central air)!

- Hardwood floors throughout

- Stainless steel kitchen appliances (dishwasher, fridge, stove)

- Nice natural light

- Coin-operated laundry in basement of building

- There is no storage available in or outside of the unit, so someone that doesn't have a ton of belongings is ideal since you'll be limited to the space in your room. (There is a den in the unit, but I use that room in its entirety and it is not available for your use. This is reflected in the price).

- No pets please


The neighbours on the street are close-knit, friendly, and family oriented. It's a warm, safe community.


The neighbours in our building are pleasant 20-30 somethings. I've been in this unit for 6 years and I've been very happy here.


About Me:


I'm a 30 year old woman who works from home most days as I run my own successful business of over 10 years. If you’re wondering what a roommate who works from home would be like, in my case I just work quietly between my desk in my room, and on my laptop in the living room (can’t sit in the same place all day haha).


I’m tidy, friendly, responsible, respectful, financially secure, tend to keep to myself but happy to watch some TV together, I don't party or have people over very often. I’ve had a few roommates over the years and they would all describe me as being very easy to live with. I can provide references if you like.


Looking For:


Looking for a roommate who is: a professional female ideally in the same age range (late 20's early 30's) who is responsible, friendly, quiet, and respectful. Since I work from home, I’d prefer a roommate who works outside of the home in a full time position.


Looking for someone who has all of the attributes one would want in a roommate: clean and tidy, cleans up after themselves especially in the kitchen, doesn’t leave clutter around, that kind of thing. I’d like someone who is quiet and doesn't play music or TV too loudly (the sound really carries).


I like to keep the apartment pretty quiet and peaceful, I wouldn’t want people coming in and out a lot. A couple friends over once in a while is perfect, but I wouldn’t want it to be a regular hang out spot.


I'm past the drinking/party phase of my life and looking for someone in the same boat.


Ideal roommate in a word? Chill. (Please, no drama or crazies, you know who you are haha).


You would pay me $975 on the 25th of each month and this covers all costs. Of course if the expenses change considerably, I would adjust this figure. However costs have stayed pretty consistent over the years so I don’t expect this to be an issue.


Being completely financially secure and able to pay on time every month is a must, which should go without saying. I don’t mess around with this, so if $975 sounds like it could be tight for you, this won’t be a good fit.


If you're interested, send me a message with some info about yourself! I will reply to those who seem like they could potentially be a good fit and we can go from there :)

To move into your own place? Move in with your beau? Ditch the awful roomy? Move to the coolest of neighbourhoods? Impress your friends by being in the know for all the best restaurants and food stands in Centretown West/ Hintonburg?

This lovely, sunny, cozy 2 BR apartment is your answer! Available September 1st.

Located on the 2nd floor of a house, this place has TWO bedrooms that are pretty much the same size. No need to draw the short straw of who gets the tiny room.

Open concept kitchen, living room with south facing windows for all your sunshine needs in Ottawa’s dreary winter.

Not only do you get a great apartment, you also get your own front yard patio (not a balcony). The patio space is located on the ground level which means you can put a BBQ! Take that high-rise buildings!

Landlord lives next door, which is super convenient if Sunday eve at 8pm you have an apartment emergency. :-)

What else do you get in this unit?

&middot; Hardwood throughout most of the unit, new carpet in one bedroom. Carpet is much nicer on the tootsies when you wake up in the morning!

&middot; All old crappy windows replaced so you stay draft-free warm.

&middot; Heat, water and hot water.

&middot; A walkability index of 90 out of 100 which means you can pretty much walk anywhere you need.

&middot; A bike score of 100 out of 100!!! Biker’s heaven!

&middot; A transit score of 90 out of 100. Pretty dang awesome for Ottawa.

&middot; This place is even in range of those new e-scooters -awww yeah!

&middot; Close proximity (700m) to Lebreton Station and the new Confederation LRT Line for all your commuting needs.* (when it's running :S)

&middot; Living a life that is far too close to delicious places such as Art-Is-In (200m), Bridgehead’s main roastery (280m), Ward 14 (240m) Peitro's Corner (110m), Pubwells (62m). Or go across the tracks to a plethora of restaurants).

&middot; Burn all the good food off at Plant Recreation Centre (190m), the new O-Train Bike Paths, Ottawa River Bike Paths, Beaver Boxing (87m) or by walking through Chinatown, Little Italy, Hintonburg or to your downtown work or school.

What is extra?

&middot; Hydro (aka electricity). How much is it a month? I really can’t say since I don’t know if you live by candle light and are never home or have 10 plasma TVs and never leave your apartment/ home office.

&middot; Parking. Street parking is availble through the City.

No laundry on premises, although the previous tenant had an arrangement with the downstairs to do laundry in their unit.

Questions about pets? Let's chat. Totally cool with a goldfish, not so cool with a pit viper (Ottawa Bylaw agrees).

Additional Information:

About me: My name is Maddie, I am a 25 year old woman who has lived in this unit since September 2019. I work fulltime in the service industry, with various hours. I also have a small female, fully trained and friendly dog who also lives here. Looking for a roommate with a similar lifestyle to move in who can also hopefully become a friend. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, going out to eat, drinks/socializing with friends, exercising and outdoor activities. I’m very easy going, and friendly so I’m looking for someone of a similar mindset.


About the apartment: This is a two bedroom townhouse with one full bathroom and a powder room. The unit is three floors with a spacious furnished rooftop patio. The kitchen features a dishwasher and is fully furnished. The living room is already fully furnished with a tv. Your bedroom would be unfurnished. The unit also includes a washer/dryer and central air. This unit is in a great area as it is located a five minute walk to both streetcars (501 and 504) as well as the Dufferin 29 bus and is a ten minute walk to all the shops and restaurants in Liberty Village, as well as Exhibition Go.

Popular with students, SO - this one's for your parents! We are landlords who care. Unfortunately many properties are run by absentee landlords who rent their apartments unclean and with many things broken. This will never happen with us. We own a small number of rentals, we keep up with regular maintenance, and we know all our tenants by name. Students are our specialty and we understand university life, pressures and needs. Yes, we'll fix the toilets of course, but a good tenancy is about so much more than that. We have two children ourselves so we know how much you will worry sending them away.

This naturally bright country house with its porches and windows on all four sides offers a spectacular view of the property and its natural beauty. With the house being about three hundred feet from the highway, this property is very private around the house and pool areas, especially from May to October, when distant neighbours cannot be seen or heard.


The property is located in the municipality of Saint-Paul-d'Abbostford in the heart of Qu&eacute;bec's Mont&eacute;r&eacute;gie region. The vill&eacute;giature atmosphere and fertile soils of the St-Paul area have attracted cultivators and artisans alike. The area is known for producing quality apples, maple syrup and wine.


Ideally located this beautiful property is:


- About 10 kilometers from Granby and its big stores

- About 40 minutes from the Champlain Bridge in Montreal

- About 13 minutes from exit 55 on Autoroute 10

- Half way between Montr&eacute;al and Sherbrooke

- About 30 minutes from Bromont ski hill.

- About 50 minutes from Sutton ski hill

- About 50 minutes from vill&eacute;giature towns of Knowlton and Sutton

- About 7 minutes from the village of St-Paul-d'Abbotsford
