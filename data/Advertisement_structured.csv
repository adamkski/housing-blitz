If you're planning a family getaway this autumn, we welcome you to come stay in beautiful Combermere / Barry's Bay cottage country! From clear waterways and nature walks to touristy shops with unique finds and amazing restaurants, this area offers it all. It's also only an hour from Algonquin Park, so it's perfect for a day trip. If you need to escape to a peaceful retreat or just want to enjoy a week or weekend on the water with family, this is the place. If you want serenity, privacy, peace and to have fun, this cottage is located only 2 hours west of Ottawa and a few hours north of Toronto.


The cottage sits on a 1/2 acre lot with beautiful views of Negeek Lake and the Madawaska River. At this west facing 3 bedroom rustic cottage, you will see sunsets that take your breath away. The open concept 850 square feet allows plenty of room. Just as appealing is the airy 250 square foot screened in deck overlooking the fire pit and waterfront, offering a peaceful retreat from pesky bugs. Even on a rainy day, this large sheltered area is a great space whether you want to read a book or play a game of cards. At night, go sit by the fire or simply listen to the loons. Combermere is their haven. Make yourself at home in this spacious cottage. The back side of the cottage offers a large flat grassy area, so set up a net for volleyball or badminton, or just let the kids play. It's away from the water and visible from the cottage.


Want to get out on the river? A 14 foot aluminum boat is at your disposal, along with a paddle boat available to rent for a minimal fee. Maybe you'll go over to one of the 2 nearby islands and have a picnic, or perhaps you'd like to catch some fish for a meal. This location gives you access to over 90 km of waterways with great fishing and boating. Also, the 100 feet of natural shoreline has a sandy bottom with a gradual slope, so you have peace of mind when the kids are in the water. Feel free to bring your own watercraft. Our 30+ foot dock is at your disposal, and a boat launch is only 5 minutes away. In addition, boat and motor rentals are available just across the lake.


Something new we’ve added this year!! Want to get out for a game of golf or an evening of music & Karaoke at one of the local pubs? We have a very reliable, mature, kind and kid loving babysitter who would love to entertain your children. Let us know ahead of time, and we can check her availability!


When summer is over, the area takes on a whole new look and feel, and some would say it is the most beautiful time of all. For those of you who know you’ll be able to take some long awaited vacation time this fall or perhaps want a quiet, peaceful place in nature to work remotely when the autumn leaves begin to turn, this is the place. There is no better location to see the beauty of nature and the fall colours than here.


We ask that you please bring your own towels and linens, as well as drinking water.

Take advantage of class A fishing and hunting! We encourage you to bring your bikes & ATV's and explore the trails filled with bird and wildlife or jump in a kayak or paddleboat and tour the lake. After a day on the water and under the sun, lie back under the night sky and look up at the stars. You will not see anything like it in your city.


The space

Our Farmhouse (nicknamed “Byng House” after the original owner here) has recently been updated from top to bottom. Built in 1895, the property was primarily used for farming; if these walls could talk, they would have plenty of stories to tell! Typical of houses from this era, the doorways may be a little shorter than you're used to. If you're tall, remember to make like a duck! The beautiful rustic farmhouse can accommodate up to 6 guests.


Upon arrival you will be greeted by a large fully equipped country eat-In kitchen with comfortable seating for 6. Tucked away in the corner is the staircase up to the master loft that offers privacy from the rest of the house.


The living room offers comfy couches with a 46” LED Smart TV and Blu-ray player for any rainy days with lots of movies to enjoy plus board games and puzzles to keep you busy too. Off the living room is what we’ve called the “wet room” with a 3-piece bath, including a stand-up shower, lots of storage space for all your clothes and an area for changing from wet to dry.


Above the living room, our second loft space has 2-bedrooms and a washroom with a clawfoot soaker tub. The bedrooms are nice and quiet and away from traffic areas if you’re having a late-night campfire out front.


Every room in the farmhouse has been given a facelift with brand new pine ceilings (the smell of fresh wood is amazing), pot (LED) lighting on the main level, new flooring, new fixtures in both full washrooms and freshly painted throughout. Being a country property, the internet is touch and go as there is no wired service. However, full LTE service is available if you'd like to connect to Instagram your moments with friends or connect to the smart TV with your smart phone or tablet.


Our farmhouse can accommodate up to 6 guests. However, If you need more space, we have it! Ask us about our campsites, our glamping Yurts, our cabins and RV-sites. We can bundle them together with the Farmhouse so you can have all your friends join you in the most authentic, yet inexpensive wilderness experience you can get without actually having to rough it!


And don’t forget our firepit—the best night is one spent sitting around a campfire with your family and friends enjoying food, beverages, music, starlight by firelight…


Guest access

Guests have access to all of the land, feel free to explore the land at your will. NO hunting is permitted on the land but makes for a great home base for those wanting accommodation while on a hunting or fishing trip.


Guests are also welcome to use our small fishing boats, appropriate boating license required.


Other things to note

Guests should be advised that this is an area that is popular among hunters. We do not allow hunting on our property, however, during peak hunting season you may hear them in early morning and late evening hours.


Min Stay: 6 Nights

Max Stay: 28 Nights

Price: $1100 for 6 nights + a one time $95 cleaning fee


Testimonials

Great spot for a weekend away from it all. Enjoy watching the stars by a bonfire! Great fall get away location.

- Jeff Oct 2019


Melissa and Nick are incredible hosts! We were the first to stay at their newly renovated property, and it surpassed all of our expectations. They went above and beyond preparing the space for us - they offered dozens of clean towels, kayaks, a motor boat, fishing rods, an air mattress, and even a 6 pack of Ontario craft beer! I would absolutely recommend everyone to book this trip. 10/10, 5 stars, 100% rating!

- Artem Sept 2019


We had a great stay! The farm house was newly renovated and clean. Melissa, her husband Nic & their business partner Simon have done a great job getting the farm house ready. We arrived to a generous gift basket of wine & doggie treats. Their generosity & hospitality continued the entire stay. They were always near by & helpful if we needed them, but gave us our privacy at the same time. We loved view from the porch of farmhouse, fishing, hiking, kayaking and visiting local attractions. We would definitely recommend staying here and hope to go back soon.
