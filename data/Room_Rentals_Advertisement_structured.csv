Private bedroom + Shared spaces + Internet + Utilities


Hello : }
I live close to the Walkley and Bank street intersection and I’m looking for a female roommate (one only, please) who’s clean, organized and respectful.

The room is furnished and unfortunately that can’t be removed since I don’t have extra space for it. The mini fridge is optional and you will have to get a tray to use it, just in case we’re out of power because the defrost could damage the floors.

I prefer to have a roommate who can stay a minimum of 10 months or a year, because I usually work 40 hours or more per week, and it’s hard to book viewings during working hours. Utilities and internet are included on that price.
My roommate won’t be added as a tenant but as an occupant.
We have rules in place so everyone who lives here help with cleaning shared spaces.
Any form of harassment, aggressive behaviours or such are forbidden, and will end this agreement.

The room would be great for a student because I do work long hours for most part and a student would have a long quiet time to focus on what’s important.

For bus route rides add: 2975 Albion Road North

*There are two bus stops in front of the building and a bus station that is only few blocks away.
*Right on the next block there’s a Circle K, Dairy queen, pharmacy and dollar store.
*Walking distance (1.2Km) to Food Basics, Rexall Drugstore, Tai Express, Good Life Fitness, Tim Hortons, Dollorama, Shawarma restaurant, Popeyes, Little Caesars...

*I offer one monthly car ride to the grocery store, if necessary.

I have a pet , so the roommate needs to be ok with being around a super friendly three years old cat. He spends most of his time in the living room.
I wouldn’t accept another pet because I tried that before and he didn’t adjust.

If you want to have house parties I’m not sure if this is the right place for you.
I don’t mind few reunions here and there or a partner visit but I wouldn’t like to have guests at my place almost everyday. Your boyfriend/partner won’t be living here as well, because I’m renting the room for one person. So your partner will be able to visit but not stay for days. Unless they live far, don’t see you often and are traveling here to see you.

Very loud noises would definitely be reported by the neighbours on the building emergency line, since most of the neighbours are families with young children and the landlord will be sending someone to knock on our door.

The apartment is simple but very cozy and I usually keep it clean.

First and last month rent are required and the room is available now.
If you decide to take the room and have received a confirmation by email through me, you will have to fill out an occupancy form from my landlord following of first and last month payments, otherwise I won’t be able to hold it for you. Even if you’re moving in days after or next month.
The landlord is going to do a background check on you. You will be required to fill up the full police check form.

Additional costs:

(Optional)
•The landlord charges a fee for air conditioner use during the summer.
The fee is usually around $180 per season for each unit and we are allowed one air conditioner per unit.
The building manager posts a sign on the wall informing the price.

(Essential)
•You will receive a laundry card where you can load by using your debit card or credit card. It costs $2,25 for each load (Washer or Dryer).

(Optional)
•Parking spots:
Outdoor spots costs $40 and Indoor $55. Sometimes there’s a waiting list for those and you will need to contact the office and check on availability. These prices can change according to the landlord.
—————————————————————————————

If you have any questions or would like to book a viewing, please contact me by direct message and I can scheduled it properly, respecting social distancing.
I will answer as fast as I can and let you know my availability.

Thank you and have a great day!",Yes,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,

Full-Time working male (60+ hours/week) seeking housemate to share 3 bedroom furnished* town house.

Available for August 1st, August 15th, or September 1st. Earliest date preferred.


* New coffee/end tables are ordered, waiting on delivery. You will need your own bedroom furnishings but there is an available queen size bed in the spare room that could be used temporarily.


Female preferred (cats are anxious around other males and I've always had a positive experience with female housemates, previous tenants will provide a recommendation if required). Although it is a 3 bedroom town house I am only interested in ONE adult to share the house with. You will have full access to the entire house, this is not a room-for-rent. My current housemate is moving out only to be closer to her family/work and she will provide a personal reference if required. I am very clean and keep to myself. There are also 2 cats that live with me or I guess you could say that I live with them! Due to this, the ad is listed as pet friendly but one additional cat would be the absolute maximum.


Please note: I will not be accepting the first qualified applicant and will be very thorough and selective with my decision. I feel it is very important to find someone compatible when it comes to sharing a house.

I am listing the rental amount at $630/month. This amount includes High Speed Internet (with Netflix!) and House Insurance (mandated by the landlord) but does NOT include Gas (Enbridge), Hydro (Ottawa Hydro), or Parking (if required). Hydro and Gas would be split 50/50 (estimates below). Outdoor parking is also available from the landlord (not me) at an additional rate of $45/month (it's actually $44/month until December).


Rental Breakdown (Estimated Bills)

Base Rent: $630

Enbridge Gas: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

Ottawa Hydro: $40-$70/month (split 50/50 = $20-$35 each)

• These amounts are estimates only and averages based off the previous year. This is to give you an annual estimate only. Some months may be much higher, some months may be much lower (heating in the winter, over all hot water usage, a/c units, laundry volume, etc). Your estimated monthly average would be in the $670 to $700/month range (+$45 if parking is required).


Only my name would be on the physical lease and utility bills but we would be signing both a Roomers and Boarders Agreement, along with a Roommate Agreement. I will provide signed receipts for rent and bills. I'm interested in a minimum of 1 year (longer preferred but not required) with month-to-month afterwards unless we agree to commit to another year. 60 days notice must be provided by either of us in order to terminate the tenancy agreement. Last month's rent (not including bills) will be required upon signing the agreement and first month's rent will be due upon move-in date (pro-rated daily if you move in mid-month).


House details;

• 3 Bedroom

• 2 Entrances

• 1.5 Bath (1 Full large bathroom upstairs + 1 toilet/sink downstairs)

• 90% furnished • if you have house furnishings we can discuss which of our furnishings are used throughout the house and which are stored in the basement.

• Fridge, Stove, Microwave, Washer/Dryer (new).

• no dishwasher

• no central air-conditioning. You can install a window unit in your bedroom and/or living room but it will affect our Ottawa Hydro bill total in the summer months. I will still be splitting the bill 50/50 as I do have a window unit in my room and would benefit from any additional a/c units.

• Unfinished Basement (lots of storage room).

• close to pretty much every type of store, walking distance to Farmboy, Gas Station, and Bus

• small playground in front of house

• smokers welcomed but NOT in the house, ever.

I am a 30 year-old professional female looking for a roommate for the apartment I am currently in. Full-time professional females only please. The room will be available as of this fall. Let me know when you were looking to move, I’m relatively flexible.


The Room, Location, Etc:


One bedroom available in a two bedroom apartment in Westboro (near the Superstore, Richmond Rd/Kirkwood area).


The room will not be furnished. The photos of the room with furniture are from a previous roommate to show scale.


- The room is fairly large measuring in at 11’11” x 11’2” with a large window and large closet

- The unit is on the main floor of a triplex

- The unit has one shared bathroom

- Street parking only, or if you wanted, there is a paid underground lot nearby (5 minute walk). There is no parking space available for you on the premises since I occupy the only space for the unit.

- Ideal for either someone who doesn't drive, OR works ~9-5 type of hours in order to avoid bylaw tickets during the weekdays (bylaw doesn’t patrol our street on weekends)

- 5 minute walk to Westboro bus station (OC Transpo) which connects to LRT

- 2 minute walk to Superstore

- 5 minute walk to Farm Boy

- 3 minute drive to the highway on/off ramps

- Not a far walk or drive to Wellington West (Wellington Village), Hintonburg, Tunney’s Pasture, even downtown is a quick drive down Scott Street, the parkway, Richmond Rd, or the highway

- Air conditioning (central air)!

- Hardwood floors throughout

- Stainless steel kitchen appliances (dishwasher, fridge, stove)

- Nice natural light

- Coin-operated laundry in basement of building

- There is no storage available in or outside of the unit, so someone that doesn't have a ton of belongings is ideal since you'll be limited to the space in your room. (There is a den in the unit, but I use that room in its entirety and it is not available for your use. This is reflected in the price).

- No pets please


The neighbours on the street are close-knit, friendly, and family oriented. It's a warm, safe community.


The neighbours in our building are pleasant 20-30 somethings. I've been in this unit for 6 years and I've been very happy here.


About Me:


I'm a 30 year old woman who works from home most days as I run my own successful business of over 10 years. If you’re wondering what a roommate who works from home would be like, in my case I just work quietly between my desk in my room, and on my laptop in the living room (can’t sit in the same place all day haha).


I’m tidy, friendly, responsible, respectful, financially secure, tend to keep to myself but happy to watch some TV together, I don't party or have people over very often. I’ve had a few roommates over the years and they would all describe me as being very easy to live with. I can provide references if you like.


Looking For:


Looking for a roommate who is: a professional female ideally in the same age range (late 20's early 30's) who is responsible, friendly, quiet, and respectful. Since I work from home, I’d prefer a roommate who works outside of the home in a full time position.


Looking for someone who has all of the attributes one would want in a roommate: clean and tidy, cleans up after themselves especially in the kitchen, doesn’t leave clutter around, that kind of thing. I’d like someone who is quiet and doesn't play music or TV too loudly (the sound really carries).


I like to keep the apartment pretty quiet and peaceful, I wouldn’t want people coming in and out a lot. A couple friends over once in a while is perfect, but I wouldn’t want it to be a regular hang out spot.


I'm past the drinking/party phase of my life and looking for someone in the same boat.


Ideal roommate in a word? Chill. (Please, no drama or crazies, you know who you are haha).


You would pay me $975 on the 25th of each month and this covers all costs. Of course if the expenses change considerably, I would adjust this figure. However costs have stayed pretty consistent over the years so I don’t expect this to be an issue.


Being completely financially secure and able to pay on time every month is a must, which should go without saying. I don’t mess around with this, so if $975 sounds like it could be tight for you, this won’t be a good fit.


If you're interested, send me a message with some info about yourself! I will reply to those who seem like they could potentially be a good fit and we can go from there :)

It is located 2.5 km from Ciena/ Nokia/Kanata North. 7 minute walk to the south March conservation area for hiking and walking and biking. Parking is allowed on both sides of Street so having guests over is not an issue. There is also one parking spot on drive way for guests

About me: I'm an embedded software engineer in my late twenties. I came from Toronto a few years back and loved Ottawa and stayed. I like to make friends and enjoy cross-country skiing and running. I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I love to cook, my most ambitious project is spit roasting whole lamb. I have lived with roommates for the last 10 years and I got along with the majority.

The room itself is not furnished, however the common areas are. Unfortunately, the building does not feature an elevator, so it is not accessible for mobility issues.

Please note that the two current roommates have severe nut and peanut allergies so we maintain a nut/peanut free home. We provide more information on this below. This is listed as no pets as we already have one living in the apartment.


Here's some information about us:

We are two females in their mid twenties, one student and one working professional.


We do enjoy hanging out from time to time, so we are looking for someone who is interested in joining a group dynamic on occasion (ie; movies, dinners, going for walks, etc.)


One of the roommates has an adorable bunny that is free roam, so we are looking for someone that is comfortable with animals and, unfortunately, does not have pets themselves. While the rabbit is free roam he will generally be in this roommates bedroom and sometimes the living room.


We strive to make sure that everyone in our house feels safe and comfortable, because of this we are only looking for female applicants and are hoping to find someone that is understanding of anti-oppression politics and sensitivities surrounding the current affairs.


Beyond that we are open and looking forward to meeting you!


Important things to know:

This is a smoke free and alcohol free apartment out of respect for one of our roommates.

There are also severe and life threatening nut and peanut allergies, for this reason we ask that roommates do not bring in any nut/peanut products, whether it’s food related (this includes not bringing in bulkbarn or similar products) or hygiene related (ie: hair oil, lotion…). We are happy to go over the specific ingredients and items that are issues so that everyone feels comfortable.


EXPERIENCE WITH OR OR BEING KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT ALLERGIES IS PREFERRED


If you are interested we would love to hear from you, for convenience we have even prepared a tenant interview sheet

I live on Marier Avenue just off Montreal Road. Our apartment is on the second floor, up a flight of stairs on the side of the building. Rent is 1150$ per month, so 575$ each as well as split cost of utilities. Our building has three apartments including us, a downstairs neighbor and a neighbor at the back of the building.


The apartment layout is our two bedrooms, one at the front and on at the back (the front is the one that belongs to my roommate right now), a bathroom with a bathtub, the kitchen, and in the middle a large common room that we use as a living room/dining area. I have a tv screen with an hdmi cable and dvd player. There is an external air conditioning unit that we use in the summer. All you need to bring is your bedroom furniture, there is also a large wardrobe that comes with the room which you can keep or if you prefer your own furniture we can get the landlords to come and remove it before you move in.


We have a washer and dryer in the apartment (!!!!) and are right by the 19, 12 and 15 bus routes, as well as a slightly longer walk to the 7 and 6 on Beechwood Avenue. The LCBO and Jean Coutu pharmacy are around the corner, Shoppers Drug Mart is a five minute walk and there are several grocery stories within walking distance (Loblaws, Fresh Co and Metro).


About me, I turn 24 this month. I graduated from university a couple years ago and I'm working at home right now during the pandemic. I'm a nonbinary lesbian (a Them), so you have to be normal about that. I would like to live with someone in their 20s, and I would prefer to live with a woman or woman-aligned person.


I drink regularly and smoke (weed) socially, and I love horror movies, the kind of music gay people listen to (I have a record player AND a tape player ... embarrassment ...), cartoons, and a bunch of other stuff. My girlfriend comes over sometimes, and I sometimes leave to visit her at her house, provided my roommate is happy with taking care of the cat for the weekend. Speaking of which...


I have a cat and I really love him, his name is Archie (full name Archie From Riverdale) and he's around 4 years old. He has FIV, which is essentially cat HIV and means that he's immunodeficient and more likely to become sick. That means unfortunately I probably won't gravitate towards people with their own cats, but if your cat is fully indoors and friendly with other cats I'm up for talking with you about it because FIV is not easily transmitted between cats (usually through blood from fighting). If your cat is also FIV that's a discussion we can have too as they won't pose a risk of transmission! He is a very healthy and happy boy, and very friendly. He has charmed a nation. The nation is the people who come to this apartment and see him.


My roommate's bedroom is not pictured here but if you're interested you can come over and I'll give you a tour! I think I've covered everything I wanted to say, if I think of anything later I will edit this post. Message me if you have any questions.",No,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two rooms available. We are only seeking one housemate, so if you have need of more than one room, that is an option. One is a smaller upstairs room that looks out over our beautiful back yard. The other is a cheerful, recently-renovated basement room with a private two-piece bathroom—i.e., sink and toilet. (The ceiling is 5' 11"" or 180 cm high, so may not be suitable for you if you are tall.) The bathtub and shower are located upstairs and are shared.


Includes full access to house and kitchen. Internet included. Laundry facilities for minimal extra fee. We live in a small cohousing community with lots of friendly interactions with our neighbours, and a gorgeous, large shared back yard.


We are a very friendly, active older couple with lots of interests. We have hosted many people, including students from 16 countries. We have great references from our past boarders, and can pass on contact information for them.


Because of the current situation with Covid-19, it is absolutely necessary that you be very serious about taking proper precautions for everyone’s safety—including a possible 14-day period of quarantine. We can discuss how this might be done.

Simon et Orian


----


Hi there, we are looking for a roommate to share a beautiful townhouse in Vanier North, starting from early August. We are Orian and Simon, both originally from Montreal, having moved to Ottawa to pursue our careers. We are looking for someone with whom we could have a great dynamic, built on respect, open communication, shared interests and activities, as well as clean common spaces ;)


The townhouse is located close to Beechwood Avenue, where one can find several pubs, coffee shops, and restaurants, as well as a supermarket. The Riverain and Stanley parks are close-by, and access to the Rideau River Eastern Pathway is easy.


A 15 to 25m bus ride will get you to University of Ottawa, the ByWard Market, Parliament Hill, and the National Gallery. Built on 2 stories with a basement, the dwelling is spacious and well-lit and has 2 powder rooms in addition to a shared bathroom. A private backyard is perfect for lounging on a deck chair or grilling on the barbecue. A moderate amount of storage space is available for sports equipment, etc. The kitchen is equipped with appliances and tools for all cooking endeavors.

A good-sized room (130 sq. ft., 9'2""x14') with closet is available. The room is not furnished and the rent is set at 780$/month. All is included is this price: gas, hydro, air conditioning, water, and an unlimited highspeed Internet connection (100Mbps download). Liability and content insurance is extra.


Please contact us if you would like to meet us, visit the flat and see the available rooms. Please include a phone number and a brief presentation.


Looking forward to meeting you! :)

If you own a farm with horses and are considering taking on a trustworthy, quiet and reliable tenant, to help pay some of your bills and help out with some chores...


I'm a quiet person and looking for a non-smoking, quiet, clean, and peaceful atmosphere.


I'm a mature, older, non-smoking, capable and healthy female who would love to live/retire on a horse farm and spend some of my time helping out with chores and help care for the horses and/or other animals. I can think of no other way that I would like to spend my free time for the long term.


I'm looking in the Ottawa and surrounding area preferably, but would consider moving a bit further out. I'm not in a hurry to move immediately and am taking my time trying to find the right place/fit.


I'm currently employed full time and thinking of retiring in the next year or so.


PLEASE NOTE - I'm not looking for a free place to live in exchange for fill time farm work. I am expecting to pay monthly rent which can be discussed, but perhaps a bit of a reduction if you could use some help with chores.


I would be happy to provide personal and professional references.

We have a third-floor room with northern exposure in a beautiful Victorian home available in Centretown. The room is warm, quiet, and snug, being at the two floors away from many of the common spaces.


This home itself has plenty of character—high ceilings, beautiful crown mouldings, and intricate woodwork, to highlight just a few of its many attributes. Many of the light fixtures are original and there is hardwood flooring throughout. There is a beautiful and recently landscaped backyard, with ample space to read and entertain, and recently renovated bathrooms.


The house is a 5 bedroom house with a formal dining room, sitting room, TV room (with flat screen TV + Netflix and Amazon Prime), eat-in kitchen, 4 bathrooms. Note that you would share a bathroom with a full shower, sink and toilet with only one other roommate.


Despite being a beautiful house, the best thing is arguably the location—right in the heart of Ottawa’s Centretown; steps away from Bank St. and close to all forms of transportation. Massine’s Independent Grocer is just around the corner (a blessing during Ottawa’s long winter) and Parliament and the Supreme Court are approximately 10 minutes away on foot.


WHO ARE THE HOUSEMATES?


We are a pretty social group of five 30-something young professionals who work in various fields, including government and academe. We like spending time together and enjoy eating together or having drinks, having good conversation. That said, all of us are busy with our own careers and lives, so hanging out tends to be rather impromptu and spontaneous. Everyone is assiduously respectful of each other, ensuring that common spaces are clean and noise is kept to a minimum. We have a miniature goldendoodle house dog, featured in the image, named Buttons!


WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?


Mostly, a great fit for the house! A young professional in their late 20s or 30s who is friendly, clean, quiet and respectful.


WHAT IS INCLUDED?


Pretty much everything, which would otherwise come in the form of a bill, is included in the rent. More specifically, this includes:


• All utilities (gas and electricity)

• Extra large washer and dryer (on 2nd floor)

• High-speed wireless internet

• Bi-weekly house cleaning

• Sundries (toilet paper, paper towel, washing machine detergent, laundry detergent, hand soap, towels, etc.)


WHAT KEY INFORMATION SHOULD I KNOW?


• A damage deposit equivalent of first month’s rent will be required to secure the room.

• Monthly rent is $850. But, as indicated above, that includes pretty much everything.

• Parking is not available.

• The room is furnished.


HOW ARE WE TACKLING COVID-RELATED ISSUES?


We, as a household, are very committed to prudence in the current environment. We adhere to public health advisories and take precautions to reduce risks, and we would expect the same from those with whom we live.


For interviews, we plan on conducting them virtually, at first, followed by a face-to-face respecting physical distancing norms in the backyard. If there is a fit, we would provide a visit inside the house taking appropriate precautions (e.g. face masks).


If you are interested, send a short email about your occupation or studies and interests along with any questions you may have.

Female roommates preferred*


I am looking to renew my lease on my spacious three-bedroom apartment and need two new roommates! The apartment is located near the St Laurent mall and is close to all essential needs. (grocery, pharmacy, post office etc) It’s a quiet area with a school right across the street! Public transportation is nearby as well, it takes about 25-30 minutes to get to downtown Ottawa. (about 45-minute commute for Carlton students).


The apartment is very spacious for a three-bedroom. The rooms are unfurnished, but I can provide a mattress if needed! They can both fit a queen-sized bed easily, a desk and other smaller furniture items. And have decent closet space. Laundry is in the building (shared with the other tenants), but it is free!


I am looking for some friendly, somewhat quiet, clean, non-smoking, and respectful roommates. Also, need people that are responsible (clean up after yourself and pay your rent + utilities on time etc). Rent will be split three ways (paid directly to the landlords). Utilities + internet are extra. *Average of 50$ each per month.


I am a student myself and have one year left in my program, so ideally, I’m looking for roommates to stay 8 months. (September to April).


*The landlords are pretty strict and will require a credit check to be put on the lease and some other information in order to be approved. If you are a student too you will likely need a co-signer!


Due to COVID-19, I will not be doing any showings in person. But, I have a video tour available to send to serious inquiries!


If this sounds like it might suit you, contact me. Thanks!",No,,,,,,,,,,,,
