The apartment is modern, has plenty of light, and a very large balcony. I need to find a new tenant, as I am moving to Toronto. The one year agreement runs up until Feb 2021, afterwards it can be extended on a month to month basis, so in 5 months you would be free to move whenever you want! (only 60 days notice).

Parking is available outdoor for $200 per month/vehicle"
