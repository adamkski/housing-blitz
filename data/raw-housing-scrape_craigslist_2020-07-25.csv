The kitchen is actually quick big size for a small family with a dinner table inside. Rental fee includes electricity/Heating/water.

The reason for transferring the lease is because of my leaving Ottawa. One of the benefit for sublet is the flexibility of relative short term rental if you want. I definitely would believe you would like this area and would like to stay longer.

* Need ANY drugs, never have to put shoes on!
* Constant renovations from 6am - 4:20pm
* “Eco” toilets that only flush once a day - tyring to be GREEN!
* You must agree that I come by anytime to use your toilet! 
* Surprise unannounced water shutoffs
* Mold, cracks but I promise to paint any room with the cheapest paint I can find, probably pink or peach yellow.
* Thin windows so please use heat sparingly because while it’s all utilities included, I don’t always turn the heat on because it’s expensive.
* I’m okay if you just want to rent to grow ‘plants’

I always have someone else post my ads with a lower cost than I actually plan on renting to you. What are you going to do during a pandemic anyway? I'm SO smart right!! haha

For references, 911 knows me very well but don’t believe anything the neighbours say!! They’re just jealous I can fit 11 units into a home that can only legally have 4! I’m VERY smart. Join us for big parties on Welfare Day!
